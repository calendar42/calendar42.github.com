# C42 Documentation

To expose the power of our travel matching system.

## Organization

The documentation is divided into major thematic sections, each a collection of pages devoted to that theme.


|    |   |
| :---- | :---- |
|  **[The Big Picture](/pages/)** | The base knowledge of how our system works. How everything is connected and the use cases.
|  **[Walkthrough](/pages/walkthrough/)** | Quick tutorial with end-points. At the end of this tutorial you will be able to create your own rideshare ecosystem. |
|  **[API Behaviour Notes ](/pages/apibehaviour/)** | Very important details about Our API that you should learn before creating any complex applications.   |
|  **API** | All the endpoints of our system. You can see all the possible params you can send and responses you can receive. |


## Learning path

1. We recommend you to see [The Big Picture](/pages/) before starting anything. You can see how our system operates. Also to not get confused in calling API endpoints, its good to learn the what is a [rideshare](#rideshare), [travel-intent-pattern](#travel-intent-pattern) and [travel-intent](#travel-intent).

2. [Walkthrough](/pages/walkthrough/) is the 'Hello World' of our system. You can grasp more deeply our concept with the help of the responses and queries. It briefly shows the use case of our system.

3. [API Behaviour Notes](/pages/apibehaviour/) is the important points that you should learn before you dive in to API endpoints.

4. You can find all end-points, parameters, filters and possible responses in `API` section.
